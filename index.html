    <p class="introtext">They call me Rick. Rick Grimes. I'm the start of a television show called The Walking Dead. Hold on a second, "CAAAAROLLL!" Sorry, I thought my son was going over the wall, but he's just keeping watch. He's a good kid.</p>
    <p class="introtext">I love pugs. I don't love pugs as much as I love Georgia peaches, but who can blame me? Everyone knows how juicy they are in the heart of summer. I made this blog so that people can see cute pics of pugs.</p>
    <p class="introtext">I've just got three questions for you...</p>

  <img src="img/pug.jpeg" alt="cute pug" style="width:340px;height:300px">
  <p>I saw this pug on the internet the other day and I thought it was the cutest pug in the whole wide world. If I could have a pug like that my whole life would be perfect. I would name him John and we would hang out on the couch and watch netflix and chill.</p>

  <p>Pugs love to play. They like to play outside, inside, in cars, on the grass, in dog parks, in living rooms, in bedrooms, in bathrooms, on porches and decks, in garages and attics, and pretty much anywhere else one can think of. Pugs like to chase balls, play tug of war, chase squirrels and bugs, run around in circles trying to catch their own tail, and even try to catch their shadow. Pugs are curious creatures with very playful hearts. </p>

  <img src="img/pug3.jpeg" alt="christmas pug" style="width:400px; height 300px">
  <p>This is a christmas pug. Pugs love the holidays. They like to get presents in the form of treats and other edible things. Pugs like to open packages as well, though sometimes they may need a little bit of help. Pugs do love toys, especially toys that house a little treat inside of them. Pugs like to sip eggnog during Christmas time and have a little bit of the icing from a Christmas cookie. It would be wise to never leave a pug alone near a plate of Christmas cookies, for they will likely eat all of them while you are not looking!</p>
